How to add plugins
	- Create a heurestic script in your favorite programming language and save it to ./PLUGINS
	- Add parameters to ./PLUGINS.conf file as the following:
		[MyCoolPlugin]
		lang:my_favorite_programming_language
		code:./plugins/MyCoolPlugin.ext
		weight:value
        /!\ As an enhancement, adding plugins could be done automatically: a script that pars PLUGINS folder and update PLUGINS.conf file

What is weight ?
	Attributing a weight for each plugin allows you to me make some plugins more important 
	than other ones, and thus, make the classification more accurate
